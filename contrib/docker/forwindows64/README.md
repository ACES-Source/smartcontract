Note: This is for cross compiling windows binaries using ubuntu

# To build:

```
$ sudo docker run -ti -v <path-to-verge-source-codes>:/verge ubuntu:18.04 bash
```

After this you can run commands from the `Dockerfile` and included scripts step-by-step.
Please note that now the `Dockerfile` is not tested from scratch and may contain some errors,
so becuase this you should do commands manually.
