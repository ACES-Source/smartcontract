Notable changes
===============

Fix buffer overflow in bundled upnp
------------------------------------

Bundled miniupnpc was updated to 1.9.20151008. This fixes a buffer overflow in
the XML parser during initial network discovery.

Details can be found here: <http://talosintel.com/reports/TALOS-2015-0035/>

This applies to the distributed executables only, not when building from source or
using distribution provided packages.

Additionally, upnp has been disabled by default. This may result in a lower
number of reachable nodes on IPv4, however this prevents future libupnpc
vulnerabilities from being a structural risk to the network
(see <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6795>).

Test for LowS signatures before relaying
-----------------------------------------

Make the node require the canonical 'low-s' encoding for ECDSA signatures when
relaying or mining.  This removes a nuisance malleability vector.

Consensus behavior is unchanged.

If widely deployed this change would eliminate the last remaining known vector
for nuisance malleability on SIGHASH_ALL P2PKH transactions. On the down-side
it will block most transactions made by sufficiently out of date software.

Unlike the other avenues to change txids on transactions this
one was randomly violated by all deployed bitcoin software prior to
its discovery. So, while other malleability vectors where made
non-standard as soon as they were discovered, this one has remained
permitted. Even BIP62 did not propose applying this rule to
old version transactions, but conforming implementations have become
much more common since BIP62 was initially written.

Bitcoin Core has produced compatible signatures since a28fb70e in
September 2013, but this didn't make it into a release until 0.9
in March 2014; Bitcoinj has done so for a similar span of time.
Bitcoinjs and electrum have been more recently updated.

This does not replace the need for BIP62 or similar, as miners can
still cooperate to break transactions.  Nor does it replace the
need for wallet software to handle malleability sanely[1]. This
only eliminates the cheap and irritating DOS attack.

Minimum relay fee default increase
-----------------------------------

The default for the `-minrelaytxfee` setting has been increased from `0.00001`
to `0.00005`.

This is necessitated by the current transaction flooding, causing
outrageous memory usage on nodes due to the mempool ballooning. This is a
temporary measure, bridging the time until a dynamic method for determining
this fee is merged (which will be in 0.12).

(see <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/6793>, as well as the 0.11.0
release notes, in which this value was suggested)
