Incompatible Changes
--------------------
* Replaced the `getmemorypool` RPC command with `getblocktemplate/submitblock`
  and `getrawmempool` commands.
* Remove deprecated RPC `getblocknumber`

Bitcoin Improvement Proposals implemented
-----------------------------------------
BIP 22 - `getblocktemplate`, `submitblock` RPCs
BIP 34 - block version 2, height in coinbase
BIP 35 - `mempool` message, extended `getdata` message behavior


Core bitcoin handling and blockchain database
---------------------------------------------
* Reduced CPU usage, by eliminating some redundant hash calculations
* Cache signature verifications, to eliminate redundant signature checks
* Transactions with zero-value outputs are considered non-standard
* Mining: when creating new blocks, sort 'paid' area by fee-per-kb
* Database: better validation of on-disk stored data
* Database: minor optimizations and reliability improvements
* -loadblock=FILE will import an external block file
* Additional DoS (denial-of-service) prevention measures
* New blockchain checkpoint at block 193,000


JSON-RPC API
------------
* Internal HTTP server is now thread-per-connection, rather than
  a single-threaded queue that would stall on network I/O.
* Internal HTTP server supports HTTP/1.1, pipelined requests and
  connection keep-alive.
* Support JSON-RPC 2.0 batches, to encapsulate multiple JSON-RPC requests
  within a single HTTP request.
* IPv6 support
* Added raw transaction API.  See https://gist.github.com/2839617
* Added `getrawmempool`, to list contents of TX memory pool
* Added `getpeerinfo`, to list data about each connected network peer
* Added `listaddressgroupings` for better coin control
* Rework getblock call.
* Remove deprecated RPC `getblocknumber`
* Remove superceded RPC `getmemorypool` (see BIP 22, above)
* listtransactions output now displays "smart" times for transactions,
  and `blocktime` and `timereceived` fields were added


P2P networking
--------------
* IPv6 support
* Tor hidden service support (see doc/Tor.txt)
* Attempts to fix "stuck blockchain download" problems
* Replace BDB database "addr.dat" with internally-managed "peers.dat"
  file containing peer address data.
* Lower default send buffer from 10MB to 1MB
* proxy: SOCKS5 by default
* Support connecting by hostnames passed to proxy
* Add -seednode connections, and use this instead of DNS seeds when proxied
* Added -externalip and -discover
* Add -onlynet to connect only to a given network (IPv4, IPv6, or Tor)
* Separate listening sockets, `-bind=<addr>`


Qt GUI
------
* Add UI RPC console / debug window
* Re-Enable URI handling on Windows, add safety checks and tray-notifications
* Harmonize the use of ellipsis ("...") to be used in menus, but not on buttons
* Add 2 labels to the overviewpage that display Wallet and Transaction status (obsolete or current)
* Extend the optionsdialog (e.g. language selection) and re-work it to a tabbed UI
* Merge sign/verify message into a single window with tabbed UI
* Ensure a changed bitcoin unit immediately updates all GUI elements that use units
* Update QR Code dialog
* Improve error reporting at startup
* Fine-grained UI updates for a much smoother UI during block downloads
* Remove autocorrection of 0/i in addresses in UI
* Reorganize tray icon menu into more logical order
* Persistently poll for balance change when number of blocks changed
* Much better translations
* Override progress bar design on platforms with segmented progress bars to assist with readability
* Added 'immature balance' display on the overview page
* (Windows only): enable ASLR and DEP for bitcoin-qt.exe
* (Windows only): add meta-data to bitcoin-qt.exe (e.g. description)

Internal codebase
-----------------
* Additional unit tests
* Compile warning fixes


Miscellaneous
-------------
* Reopen debug.log upon SIGHUP
* Bash programmable completion for bitcoind(1)
* On supported OS's, each thread is given a useful name
