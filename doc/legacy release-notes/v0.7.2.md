title: Bitcoin-Qt version 0.7.2 released

Bug fixes
---------

* Prevent RPC `move` from deadlocking. This was caused by trying to lock the
  database twice.

* Fix use-after-free problems in initialization and shutdown, the latter of
  which caused Bitcoin-Qt to crash on Windows when exiting.

* Correct library linking so building on Windows natively works.

* Avoid a race condition and out-of-bounds read in block creation/mining code.

* Improve platform compatibility quirks, including fix for 100% CPU utilization
  on FreeBSD 9.

* A few minor corrections to error handling, and updated translations.

* OSX 10.5 supported again
