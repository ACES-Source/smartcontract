0.8.5 Release notes
===================

Bugs fixed
----------

Transactions with version numbers larger than 0x7fffffff were
incorrectly being relayed and included in blocks.

Blocks containing transactions with version numbers larger
than 0x7fffffff caused the code that checks for LevelDB database
inconsistencies at startup to erroneously report database
corruption and suggest that you reindex your database.

This release also contains a non-critical fix to the code that
enforces BIP 34 (block height in the coinbase transaction).

Thanks to Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille for quickly
identifying and fixing the transaction version number bug.
