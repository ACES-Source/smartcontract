0.9.1 Release notes
-------------------

No code changes were made between 0.9.0 and 0.9.1. Only the dependencies were changed.

- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1g. This release fixes the following vulnerabilities which can
  affect the Bitcoin Core software:

  - CVE-2014-0160 ("heartbleed")
    A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension can
    be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or server.

  - CVE-2014-0076
    The Montgomery ladder implementation in OpenSSL does not ensure that
    certain swap operations have a constant-time behavior, which makes it
    easier for local users to obtain ECDSA nonces via a FLUSH+RELOAD cache
    side-channel attack.

- Add statically built executables to Linux build
