=======================

RPC:

- Add paranoid return value checks in base58

Protocol and network code:

- Add a way to limit deserialized string lengths and use it
- Add a new checkpoint at block 295,000
- Increase IsStandard() scriptSig length
- Avoid querying DNS seeds, if we have open connections
- Remove a useless millisleep in socket handler
